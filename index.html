          At this point, I'm sick of AI being pushed as this big next step in technology when in all actuality it's a giant buzzword-laden bubble that's bound to pop with all of the issues plaguing it and my own personal experiences trying to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm tired of every single browser, IDE and tech company trying to shoehorn AI into their workflow, trying to convince everyone that it's better to use a machine that tries to guess what you wanna hear from it's database instead of trying to use a search engine to find exactly what you're looking for.
        </p>

        <code>
          Not to mention that all the larger AI companies are still being investigated and sometimes even sued over their databases potentially being filled with mountains of stolen data, art, etc.

          You know, I still think about the time I tried to use ChatGPT once to try and solve an issue I was having with Microsoft Teams. I was searching online to see if a feature even existed (spoilers, it didn't), and it was suggested that I tried asking ChatGPT for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd already had apprehensions about using the software, but frankly I figured that I may as well try it at least once to see if it actually worked.
        </p>

        <code>
          It gave me the EXACT SAME "SOLUTION" that I got from every single human-made response to that question. It was at this moment that I decided I'd never intentionally use ChatGPT or any of the larger AI chatbots again, and I will continue to not do so no matter what.

          It's not just a user thing either, there are concerns that the massive server farms these AI companies make and maintain are causing serious ecological damage because of how many resources they need to keep up with the recent demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd rather not boil an entire lake's worth of water just to ask a bot to write a stupid email for me.

          Does this mean I hate anyone who uses AI themselves? No, that's a bit much. Y'all are adults with free will, if you want to use these programs to write code or do whatever, I can't stop you... 
        </p>

        <p>
        But I might poke fun at you once in a while.

          I mean seriously, why do you need a robot to write an email for you?

          Put simply, I'm not a fan of the modern push for AI right now. Between the shoddy outputs all of them give (not even counting how often they "hallucinate") to the way they're being forced down people's throats one way or another, I'm not hankering to use ChatGPT or whatever else is out there.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wouldn't even be so bad if more of it was open source or based around local language models that only run off your computer and not a server, but the truth is that people spent so long wondering if they could develop these chatbots that they never stopped to ask if they should. But what if you use these larger AI services but want to try and get off of it? Here's what you can do:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Use search engines instead of going straight to ChatGPT.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instead of asking AI to write something for you, figure out how you can write it for yourself and build up that skill. (For coding, I recommend this fun little site called freeCodeCamp)
          </li>
          <li>
            Try branching out and finding people to talk to in online communities if you want to be more social.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don't have the time to do something yourself or learn how to do something, pay/hire someone to do it for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            AT THE VERY LEAST, find a good local language machine so that you have your own personal AI that you own and can run off your preexisting resources instead of having to rely on someone else's service.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Can't wait for some big tech company to see all this and not hire me because I don't like their AI-powered girlfriend simulators.
